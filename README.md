### What I learned
RESPONSIVE LAYOUT
I've learned how to build a responsive structure, and how to the make element inside also responsive so that the layout is good for any display and it's able to change in a fluid way. 

### Continued development

1.I need to understand what are the best ways to make text responsive.
2.I need to understand how I can scale down the text in a proportional way, even if it changes the height and not just the width.
3.I need to understand how to optimize the work for distribution.
